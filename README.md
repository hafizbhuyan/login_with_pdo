# login_with_pdo
This is a pdo login/sign up example

Most login/sign up PHP tutorials use mysqli and that is not recommended b/c it can lead to SQL injection attacks. There aren't many login/sign up tutorials or examples out there that use PDO, so I wanted to put one here, feel free to use it for your website or app.
